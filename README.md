## ðŸ“– Background

Nickel Oxide (NiO) is a transition-metal oxide with desirable properties such as:

- High theoretical capacitance  
- Good chemical stability  
- Large surface area (when nanostructured)  
- Cost-effectiveness compared to other electrode materials  

By synthesizing NiO in a **nanoflower-like morphology**, its **electrochemical performance** can be greatly enhanced, making it suitable for:

- **Supercapacitors**  
- **Lithium-ion/sodium-ion batteries**  
- **Electrochemical sensors**  
- **Catalysis applications**

This project focuses on **hydrothermal synthesis techniques** to produce such nanostructures and assess their structural and functional properties.
